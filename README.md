# Movie Playoffs App

A Next.js application for running movie playoffs, you know, like the NBA playoffs, but for movies. I built this because when I get together with my friends, we always end up arguing about what movie to watch.

This was built entirly with Cursor + Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Even this description was written with Cursor + Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

This shit is crazy.
